    <h1 style="margin-top: 10%;">Why Choose Zoi?</h1>
    <p>That's a good question and Zoi might not be the right choice for you. I built it and continue to build it mostly as a practice exercise for using Zig. That being said, a great benefit of Zoi is that it is incredibly simple. Anyone can learn all its inner workings fairly easily and it would work as a great foundation to hack on and add any features you would like it to have. And if you develop something awesome feel free to contribute those improvements on GitHub. As a side note although speed is not necessarily a main goal of Zoi it does run lean and tends to have reasonably good response times.
