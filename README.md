Ultra simple zig server for http 1.1 over tcp.
Ultra simple zig server for http 1.1 over tcp. Has zero external dependencies and runs on dev 0.11. Currently runs single threaded although I plan to update that. I make no guarantees that it is stable as this is just a way for me to practice zig and maybe use it in my own work. But if you end up liking it you can feel free to use it. Just put the files you want to be able to deliver as statice webpages in the same directory where you run the command to start the server. Then run the server. It is set to run on port 8080 but you can change that in the code if you feel like it. As a note this is currently only tested as working in Chrome and Firefox on my local machine running Fedora Workstation.
